People have a basic right to health and to information about health – including reproductive health and abortion.\nThe BBC’s Action Line website is supposed to give people information about issues raised in BBC programs. On the Call the Midwife’s page, they offer “Information and Support” on a host of “Pregnancy related issues”: NHS Advice, which links to general pregnancy advice; Health and Wellbeing; Infertility; Pre and Postnatal Illness; Premature Birth, Miscarriage, and Still Birth; and Child Bereavement. But not abortion.\nA collection of women’s healthcare groups, including the BPAS, wrote to the BBC on Valentine’s day, asking for the decision to be reversed. Since then so many complaints have been filed, the BBC’s complaints website temporarily crashed.\nThe BBC is treating access to abortion like a dramatic device and not what it is – a healthcare issue and part of a human right to health affecting countless people who will be let down if institutions continue to fail to provide basic health information.\n",
